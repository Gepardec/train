helloworld
------------

The helloworld workshop is a exactly what it sounds like - a hello world showcasing how to set up a new workshop from scratch. Provisioning a workshop with :code:`bootstrap_file = "helloworld.sh"` in your :code:`workdir/variables.tfvars` will 

* update the OS
* install httpd
* serve a hello world message on Port 80

This is a simple and lightweight way to start experimenting with the infrastructure code in order to get familiar with terraform and how we use it in the context of workshops.

Disclaimer: The containerization workshop is not readily available yet!
